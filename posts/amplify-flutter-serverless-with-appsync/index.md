---

In this article you are going learn how to build a simple Flutter Web application that uses the Amplify SDK to talk to a serverless, AWS backend. The sample project uses Cognito for Authentication and AppSync for the API. On AppSync, you will make use of the "Merged APIs" feature which will enable you to quickly scale out this project if your project becomes "the next big hype" on the net. The deployment happens through CodeCatalyst workflows using AWS CDK.

## High-Level architecture
![The high level architecture of the project](images/high_level_architecture.png "The high level architecture of the project")
In the sample project we will use a few AWS services:
Our web-page (build in Flutter) will be hosted on Amazon S3 behind Cloudfront. Cognito will be used for Authentication. AppSync will be our API endpoint and we'll connect to DynamoDB as a database. A few API endpoints will have Lambda functions.
## Used technologies in this project
Technology wise we are using Flutter for our Front-End code, TypeScript for code on the backend. Also our infrastrcture as code is written in TypeScript.
### What is Flutter? Why Flutter?
[Flutter](https://flutter.dev) is a trending cross-platform development toolkit and altough it is mainly sponsored by Google there is a vibrant open source community. Flutter allows you to develop a user interface once and then package it for different platforms like Android, iOS, the Web or even Linux and Windows. The source code you write is being translated into natively readable code for the target platform which makes Flutter faster then other cross platform development tools.

### Using AWS AppSync - what are Merged APIs?
[AppSync Merged APIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/merged-api.html) have been announced in 2023 and empower development teams to split up responsibilities between different teams as APIs for specific endpoints can be development independently from each other.
